## Card details project

This project is a part of the [Card details](../README.md) project.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content
